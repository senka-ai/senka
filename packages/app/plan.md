# Plan for Senka Educational App

## Project Positioning

The **Senka Educational App** serves as the **flagship showcase and reference implementation** for the broader Senka no-code platform. While the primary vision is building a comprehensive AI-powered no-code development platform, this educational app demonstrates the platform's capabilities by solving real-world problems in the Romanian educational system.

**Key Role**: This app validates that the Senka platform can handle sophisticated applications with complex user roles, permissions, workflows, and real-time collaboration - proving the no-code tools work for professional-grade applications.

The goal is to develop an educational app named **Senka**, designed to support students, teachers, and parents. The plan is divided into two dimensions:

- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: Core features to launch the app and validate platform capabilities.
- **Long-Term Plan**: Features to be added over time to enhance functionality and demonstrate advanced platform features.

## MVP Plan

- **Overview**: An educational app primarily in Romanian, with support for English as a secondary display language.
- **Target Users**: Students, teachers, and parents.
- **Account Creation and Onboarding**:
  - Users select their account type (student, teacher, parent) and follow tailored onboarding steps:
    - **Students**: Join an existing class (via a code) or create a new class.
    - **Teachers**: Join an existing class or create a new class.
    - **Parents**: Enter a unique code to link their account to their child’s profile.
  - **Class Creation**:
    - Specify the school (select from a list or add a new one), grade level, and class identifier (e.g., XII-A).
    - Optionally create a class timetable or skip this step.
  - **Timetable Creation**:
    - Select subjects and time slots for each day of the week.
- **Core Features**:
  - **Teachers**:
    - Create and edit class timetables.
    - Assign tasks (homework, tests, exercises, lessons, documents) to individual students or the entire class.
    - Create educational materials.
    - Manage multiple schools where they teach.
  - **Students**:
    - View timetables in two formats: daily or weekly.
    - Access assigned tasks (homework, tests, exercises, lessons).

    - Teachers and designated students can:
      - Modify class composition (add/remove students).
      - Assign specific roles to students (e.g., edit math homework, update timetable).
- **Supported Languages**: Romanian and English.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: 
  - **Responsive Web App**: Adapts to mobile (tab-based navigation) and desktop (sidebar navigation)
  - **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Installable on mobile devices with offline capabilities
  - **Native Mobile Apps**: iOS and Android wrapper generation for app store distribution
  - **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Maintains design and functionality across all platforms

## Long-Term Plan

- **Global Expansion & Platform Validation**:
  - Initially focused on the Romanian education system, the app will gradually incorporate features tailored to other countries' educational systems.
  - **International expansion demonstrates the Senka platform's flexibility** for different markets and requirements.
  - Each new country/system validates that the no-code platform can adapt to diverse regulatory and cultural needs.
- **Two Learning Modes**:
  - **Assisted Learning**: Supports all school-related activities for students.
  - **Individual Learning**: Provides a personalized learning path, similar to Duolingo, for any subject.
- **Interactive Learning Interfaces**:
  - Examples include:
    - Auto-graded tests/exercises.
    - Manually graded tasks (by teachers or AI).
    - Customizable question formats with gamified elements.
- **AI-Powered Features** ⭐ **PLATFORM SHOWCASE**:
  - AI chat interface to assist with learning - **demonstrates Senka's conversational AI capabilities**.
  - Initial assessment to evaluate a student's level, followed by:
    - A personalized learning path generated by AI - **shows AI-powered customization**.
    - Goal-setting and a study schedule to foster discipline - **demonstrates workflow automation**.
    - Notifications to parents/teachers about adherence to the schedule - **shows multi-user coordination**.
- **Subject Customization**:
  - Subjects will have varied structures and content based on the student’s chosen specialization level.
- **Additional Features**:
  - Search functionality across various content types (lessons, tasks, materials).
  - Support for national standardized tests.
  - Real-time academic competitions within the app.
  - Digital gradebook for tracking marks.
  - Gamification to enhance engagement.
  - Communication module for interaction between students, teachers, and parents.
  - Progress tracking, showing completion percentages for chapters, lessons, or subjects.
