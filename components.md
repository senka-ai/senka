# Components

The current plan is to build UI components and their stories.

Before creating new components, you always have to check how the existing components were built (src/lib/components
folder), how their stories are created (src/lib/stories folder) and how they were initially designed (in the
~/Downloads/claude-senka/components folder).

The components should be developed step-by-step: don't move to the next component until I confirm that the current
component is working as expected.
