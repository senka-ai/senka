# Components

The current plan is to build UI components and their stories.

Before creating new components, you always have to check the existing components:

- how they were built in src/lib/components
- how their stories are created in src/lib/stories folder
- how they were initially designed in ~/Downloads/claude-senka/components

After checking the code of a component, you always also have to check its image.

When creating a new component you also have to check for its image in ~/Downloads/claude-senka/components

The components should be developed step-by-step: don't move to the next component until I confirm that the current
component is working as expected.
